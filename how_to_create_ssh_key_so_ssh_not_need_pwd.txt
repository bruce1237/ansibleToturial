1. create new ssh key
	CMD: ssh-keygen -t theKeyType[like:ed25519] -C "putCommentHere"
2. find the key generated in .ssh folder: id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub

3. add sshkey to other servers
	CMD: ssh-copy-id -i [input file] ./ssh/id_ed25519.pub [IPADDRESS-OF-Target-Server] 172.17.0.4 
	
	above command will create authorized_keys into target server .ssh folder, bassic just copy the pub key 
	into the server and renamed
4. using ssh connect to server
	CMD: ssh [target-server-ip] 172.17.0.4
	
	tip: ctrl+v to logout

TIPS:
1.	CMD: ssh -i [indicate which sshKey to use to connect by using the -C comment] putCommentHere 
2.	for sshkey using phase, put phase into variable
		CMD: eval $(ssh-agent)
		CMD: ssh-add  //to add key into ssh-agent
	then you don't have to put phase eveytime ssh connect till logout from the terminal

3.	Alias command: //create a shortcut to a list of commands 
		CMD: alias variableName='commands to rung'
